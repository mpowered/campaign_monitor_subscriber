== DESCRIPTION:

Automatically push/delete a model's email address and custom-fields to a Campaign Monitor mailing when the model is created or destroyed.

== FEATURES:

* Push email addresses and custom fields to CM on create
* Delete email address from CM on destroy

== SYNOPSIS:

Specify the model's email address field name. You can also pass additional custom fields:

  Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    subscribe_me_using :email, {"name" => "full_name", "UserStatus" => "get_status"}
  end

This will call `full_name` and `get_status` methods on record which was created using `send`.

Set the list id & api key in config/campaign_monitor_subscriber_config.yml:
  list_id: 12oeu0089oe8gf9794oe498587o5
  api_key: 23rbmoe351sd123d12134hbi1234
	development: false # disable in development

Thats it!
