== DESCRIPTION:

Automatically push/delete a model's email address and custom-fields to a Campaign Monitor mailing lists when the model is created or destroyed.

NOTE: Version 1.0.0 introduces several significant syntax changes that will cause issues if your application is not updated. See below for details.

== FEATURES:

* Push email addresses and custom fields to CM on create
* Delete email address from CM on destroy

== SYNOPSIS:

Specify the model's email address field name. You can also pass additional custom fields:

  Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    subscribe_me_using :email, :name => :full_name, :UserStatus => :get_status
  end

This will submit the users `full_name` as `name` etc.

Set the list id & API key in `config/campaign_monitor_subscriber.yml`:
  production:
    list_id: 12oeu0089oe8gf9794oe498587o5
    api_key: 23rbmoe351sd123d12134hbi1234

Campaign Monitor Subscrber will not activate for environments not specified in `config/campaign_monitor_subscriber.yaml`.

You can use different lists across your application by specifying the list_id prefixed by the list name:
  production:
    users_list_id: 12oeu0089oe8gf9794oe498587o5
    staff_list_id: oEZoeu0089oe8gf7oe123oeu234o
    api_key: 23rbmoe351sd123d12134hbi1234

Then be sure to specify the list's name in the model as follows:

  Class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    subscribe_me_using :email, :name => :full_name, :list => :users
  end

  Class Staff < ActiveRecord::Base
    subscribe_me_using :email, :name => :full_name, :list => staff
  end

Thats it!
